## 📘 What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a method of communication that uses a series of dots (.) and dashes (-) to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. It was originally developed for sending messages over long distances using telegraph systems and can also be transmitted via sound, light, or visual signals.

## 🕰️ History of Morse Code

Morse code was developed in the early 1830s and 1840s by **Samuel Morse** and **Alfred Vail**. It was designed as a way to communicate over the telegraph, an early form of long-distance electronic communication. The first successful Morse code message was sent in 1844 between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, reading: “What hath God wrought?”

Morse code played a critical role in early radio communication, military operations, and maritime distress signals (e.g., SOS).

## ⚙️ How Morse Code Works

Each letter of the alphabet, as well as numbers and some punctuation marks, is represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes:

- A dot is a short signal (e.g., a quick beep or flash).
- A dash is a longer signal (e.g., a longer beep or flash).

Letters are separated by spaces, and words are separated by slashes or double spaces.

### Example Characters:
| Character | Morse Code |
|-----------|------------|
| A         | .-         |
| B         | -...       |
| C         | -.-.       |
| 1         | .----      |
| 2         | ..---      |
| 0         | -----      |
